<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>About
  An about page reveals details about your life, working style, and experience. Clients want to know you're a talented designer, and adding a description of your background and skills helps assure them that’s what you are. If they feel confident in your abilities, they’re more likely to reach out about a project.
  Include any social media page that provides more information about you or your online work, such as LinkedIn, Behance, or Dribbble to show potential clients more of your talents.

<p>The portfolio page highlights your most impressive projects. Select a diverse group of projects that shows off a variety of skills across the industries you specialize in. Provide a description of each that covers your key role in the project, what challenges you solved, skills used, and the thinking behind the strategy so that potential clients can see what you excel at and how you approach your work.

<p>The contact page often meshes with the about page, but providing contact information is necessary so potential clients can inquire about hiring you. It’s also a great way to learn more about them. And if you want to list your available services and rates, this is a great place to do it so clients can check how much it will cost before reaching out.
